A Juju charm deploying and managing NetBox on Kubernetes.

NetBox is the go-to solution for modeling and documenting network
infrastructure for thousands of organizations worldwide. As a
successor to legacy IPAM and DCIM applications, NetBox provides a
cohesive, extensive, and accessible data model for all things
networked.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more. For Charmed NetBox, this includes:
- S3 integration
- Redis integration
- PostgreSQL integration
- SAML integration
- Cron jobs

It allows for deployment on many
different Kubernetes platforms, from MicroK8s to Charmed Kubernetes to
public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

<!-- I will add the link once the documentation posts on Discourse are ready -->
For information about how to deploy, integrate, and manage this charm, see the Official [platform-engineering-charm-template Documentation](external link).
